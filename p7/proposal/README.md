# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

A Math Teacher's Problem Sets

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I would like to create a website that allows teachers to generate question banks for particular types of math problems. There is an outstanding site,
https://www.geogebra.org/m/z8txppjn#material/PQCUvc3M which has a huge bank of these javascript applets. I teach using the Canvas LMS. I often embed
the applets from geogebra into canvas pages. The great thing about the applets is that they can generated new practice
problems. When I assess students, I create my own problems in the Canvas LMS quiz module. The Canvas LMS module is great,
but it has many limitations. For example, it does not have question types that allow students to graph. It also does not have formula question types
which allow for multiple answers.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will creat a website that is devoted to helping math teachers with math notation, and math tools in an online environment. One of the most time-consuming
and frustrating parts about teaching in the digital environment is the time it can take to create math notation, images, and symbols which properly
display on screen.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TFs below.

NA

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I learn how to create javascript applets similar to the ones already available in Geogebra. It would also be good if I were able to
develop a bank of question types, that I could use to assess students.

I learn how to manipulate HTML code by learning math notation, LaTex, ...

I have a website that shows teachers how to use some difficult features of the Canvas LMS.

I learn how to create and upload style sheets into Canvas LMS so that I can take curriculum from sites like https://illustrativemathematics.org/math-curriculum/

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

1) Embedding Desmos graphing calculator into Canvas assignments (prepouplated and blank)
2) Embedding Geogebra activities into canvas
3) Question bank of question types available for distribution
4) Database of images and questions that teachers can use to autogenerate questions

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A website which shows teachers how to create, use, and embed math content into Canvas. This could be everything from a page which shows how to embed graphing calculators,
to a page which shows teachers how to autogenerate, question types. In the long run, there would be a place for teachers to add
question types to a database of questions.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Create a website shell, .css stylesheet, and a couple of video tutorials to embed into the page. I think a big struggle will be how much time to spend on content, functionality, and aesthetics.
I have a lot of ideas about what I would like to do. Many of them come from problems that I face on a regular basis when designing curriculum.
I may even use that idea as a theme for the site. I describe a problem that I have, and then I create a solution.
