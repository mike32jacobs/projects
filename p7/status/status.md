Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I created the shell of the web application. I created a favicon.ico. I have started
my application.py process. It has functions to allow users to log-in, and register.
I also created a few of the pages (layout.html, index.html, login.html, register.html,...)
I figured our how to include a wysiwyg editor in my HTML pages. This involves using
and open-sources tinymce editor.
I have watched a number of tutorial videos on LaTex. I have also spent some time creating
the navigation of the site. I spent too much time attempting to change the colors of my menu.


#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not added content to my pages. I need to explain to the visitor what the purpose of the
page is. I also need to create some quick screencasts of me encountering the problems I am describing.
I still need to work in my application.py file to create a function which will allow the user to submit
content in an html editor.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Everything seems to take longer than I anticipated. Even creating a favicon to go in the
branding section of my navbar, took more time than I thought. I had to figure out how to
convert a .png to an .ico file which was only 16 px by 16 px. I also spent a lot of time
with bootstrap this week. I am extending my layout.html to other pages, but I now realized
that I need to extend my extension of layout.html. There are going to be a number
of pages that have a side navigation menu. All of their side navigation will be the same, so
I do not want to repeat it.
