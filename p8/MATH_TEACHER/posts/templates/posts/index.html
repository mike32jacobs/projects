                <p class="lead">Math teachers have all sorts of problems. They range from dealing with a
                    general population which suffers from math-phobia, to an intense unacknowledged
                    jealousy of English teachers. There are many more, but this website does not
                    to talk about all of them.

                            <p class="card-text"> Displaying mathematical symbols and notation will be be
                            a much easier endeavor if math teachers can add a few tools to their tool kit.
                            In particular, it will be important to understand LaTex, Mathml, and mathjax.
                            each of these can lead any math teacher down a rabbit hole for which they don't
                            have time. This section will briefly explain these three tools, and provide a few
                            resources for those who want to learn more.

                            how to display mathematical notation in distinct digital environments.
                            No matter how experienced you are, you are sure to encounter problems in
                            displaying math symbols. You might solve the problem for Google docs, only to
                            discover that your solution won't work in Google Slides. You may think you
                            have solved a problem, but discover that it is only solved for some browsers.</p>

                                Users will contribute their own questions, and they will also helped check the work of other
                                users. Eventually, these question banks will give teachers the ability to easily assign different
                                types of problems to their students. The page is currently under contruction. Check back to see this feature
                                at an unspecified date in the future.
