{% block uses %}
    When combined with LaTex and Mathml, math teachers, can use MathJax to display all sorts of mathematical notations. One of the major advantages is that the math created by mathjax is searchable, and can be read by a screen reader. This makes it much easier for teachers to create accessible content. <p>Another major advantage over other options is that when the user zooms in on mathjax rendered content, it stays crisp. </p><p> Look at the mathjax version of the quadratic formula, and compare it to the LaTex generated image of the same formula. Try zooming in on the text, and try copying and pasting the text.</p>

{% block narrative %}
    Math Jax requires a bit of setup if you are a web designer, but it is automatically included in the Canvas LMS. It allows you to take any equation and render either the mathml, or the LaTex version of the code.
