											I have taught various subjects. Algebra I, Algebra II,

											Geometry, Advanced Algebra and HTML. During Covid, I taught in a
											fully online environment and two distinct hybrid scenarios. In
											one hybrid environment, I would work with 8-14 students in the
											room, and 1-6 students online. I found ways to effectively teach
											both groups simultaneously. I used a combination of a laptop,
											iMac, ELMO document camera, and an iPad on a Swvl. Online
											students joined the class from Zoom links embedded in my Canvas
											course. I joined the Zoom meeting on all of my devices, and
											became skilled at finding ways to deliver content, and encourage
											collaboration and communication among online and in person
											students.
