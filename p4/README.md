## Notes for instructor
+ _I decided to try blackjack because it is a difficult game, and I was looking to challenge myself. As you know from looking at the early version, I was having a lot of issues._
+ _I think the biggest help was putting all of my functions in a separate file. This helped me clear my thinking and the code._
+ _Once I looked at your suggestions, I wrote the logic behind determining a winner. These are not very complex steps, but there are many possible outcomes in a game. _
+ _My initial thought was to build a player class. I know that it was not suggested, but I was hoping to eventually have multiple players play against the dealer. I ended up not using the player class._
+ _The next thing I would do (if I had time) would be to hide the dealer's first card. I did have that feature in my original code, but being able to see the dealer's hand and total made it easier for me to debug._
+ _I would also work on making this look nicer with some graphics, and color._
